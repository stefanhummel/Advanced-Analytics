# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This example demonstrates how the IBM in-database analytic
# functions can be used to read data from a JSON file.
#
#
# Attention: The first time this application is run it will create
# a table with some data. This might take several minutes.
#
# The steps carried out by this application are:
#
# (0) Read randomly created data from the JSON file
# [home directory]/SPARK_TEST_DATA.json, use the data to create a k-means
# model, and make some predictions based on the created model. Each
# point and its predicted cluster centroid are stored in the JSON file
# [home directory]/SPARK_TEST_DATA_PREDICT.json.
#
# (1) Initialize the Spark-specific components.
#
# (2) Create some random data points and write them into the JSON file
# [home directory]/SPARK_TEST_DATA.json. If this file does not already exist,
# create it. The random data points are created around following
# centroids (x,y) with different radii (r):
#   (x=0,  y=0,  r=2)
#   (x=0,  y=10, r=3)
#   (x=10, y=10, r=1)
#   (x=10, y=0,  r=2)
#   (x=5,  y=5,  r=1)
# The random points are created with help of 'scala.util.Random.nextDouble()'.
# This means the points around each centroid are uniformly distributed.
# The k-means algorithm used by this application should calculate
# similar centroids again.
#
# (3) In order to read the data with the Spark JSON data source, define
# the necessary file.
#
# (4) Because this example uses a Spark pipeline in step 6, build
# one of the components that the pipeline will need. First, create a
# VectorAssembler that takes the input columns 'PIVOT1' and 'PIVOT2'
# from the table and builds a vector representation of the two columns.
#
# (5) Define the parameters for the k-means clustering algorithm,
# which is the second component in the pipeline.
#
# (6) Combine all the components within a single pipeline.
#
# (7) All components in the pipeline are ready to go. Initialize the
# building of the model by providing the necessary input data. Now,
# the data is read from the database.
#
# (8) The cluster centroids of the data points are written out to
# standard output, which is a file with a name of the form:
# [home directory]/spark/log/submission_[submission_id]/submission.out
#
# (9) The example uses the model, which has just been trained, to
# make some test predictions based on the same data that was used for
# the training. The results are stored in file
# [home directory]/SPARK_TEST_DATA_PREDICT.json.
