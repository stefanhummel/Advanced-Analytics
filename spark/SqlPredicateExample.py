# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This example demonstrates how the IBM in-database analytic
# functions can be used to read data from a table in dashDB.
#
#
# Attention: The first time this application is run it will create
# a table with some data. This might take several minutes.
#
# The steps carried out by this application are:
#
# (0) Read randomly created data from the table
# [default_schema].SPARK_TEST_DATA and invoke some simple Spark actions.
#
# (1) Initialize some Spark-specific components.
#
# (2) Create some random data points and write them into the
# table [default_schema].SPARK_TEST_DATA. If this table does not
# already exist, create it.
#
# (3) In order to read the data with the IBM IDAX data source, define
# the necessary property 'dbtable'. Declare also the correct data
# source, which is 'com.ibm.idax.spark.idaxsource'.
# Declare a SQL predicate push down with the option 'sqlpredicate'.
#
# (4) Count the data rows in the input table and store them in a
# variable. With this action, the data is read the first time.
#
# (5) Write the number of rows to the standard output, which is
# redirected to a file with a name of the form:
# [home directory]/spark/log/submission_[submission_id]/submission.out
#
# (6) Use the data frame a second time to select some specific columns.
#
# (7) Trigger a second action, which is to write the first
# 20 rows, ordered by the ID of each row, to standard output again.
# However, since a sql predicate is defined, only the first 10 row
# will be printed actually.
#
# You can use the IBM dashDB Analytics API to invoke this application with this cURL command:
# curl -k -v -u "[userid]":"[password]" -X POST "https://[hostname]:[port]/dashdb-api/analytics/public/apps/submit"
# 	--header 'Content-Type:application/json;charset=UTF-8'
# 	--data '{
#         "appResource" : "SqlPredicateExample.py",
#         "sparkProperties" : {
#             "sparkSubmitPyFiles" : "example_utilities.egg"
#         }
#     }'

    sparkConf = SparkConf()
    sc = SparkContext(conf=sparkConf)
    sqlContext = SQLContext(sc)
    
    # (2) Create random data points and store them in a DashDB table.
    table = initializationDashDB(sc, sqlContext)
    
    # (3) Define parameters to read the data from the DB with idaxsource.
    # Also include a sql predicate.

        .format("com.ibm.idax.spark.idaxsource") \
        .options(dbtable=table, sqlpredicate="ID < 10") \
        .load()

    # (4) Trigger the action 'count' on the data frame.
    resultCount = df.count()

    # (5) Print the result of the count.
    print resultCount

    # (6) Select three columns and order the data by 'ID'.
    resultOrderBy = df.select("ID", "PIVOT1", "PIVOT2").orderBy("ID")

    # (7) Trigger the action 'show'.
    print resultOrderBy.show()
